## IS340 Term Paper: Ideation of a Syllabus Resource Center
Dharra Prashaad, Spring 2023, https://www.linkedin.com/in/d-prashaad/

### Introduction    

Being a student at a large university has its benefits and challenges. One of the benefits is that many people have taken the same classes with the same professors over the year. That can be a great source of knowledge when picking out classes for the next semester. One challenge is that due to the size of the university, it is difficult to access that knowledge. Knowing how much a class will cost due to required materials or the assignments a student is likely to face from a class can make planning for classes easier and less stressful. This project centers around creating a platform that combines the UIUC iSchool’s Syllabus Folder shared to students on Box and the UIUC Grade Disparity site (Oliver et al., n.d.). The UIUC Grade Disparity site allows students to see the average GPA of many sections of classes. If there are three different professors that teach, for example, IS 202, they can see the average GPA of all three of those sections (Oliver et al., n.d.). Unfortunately, not all classes or sections are on this site as some are new or have new professors teaching them. The platform this project aims to create would also allow students to share their experiences with classes and share resources by allowing students to comment on classes. This works to mitigate some of the drawbacks of the grade disparity site.

### Purpose    

This project’s purpose is to create a platform that will help students make more informed decisions about the classes they plan to take. By having access to all iSchool syllabuses in one place, students can compare course content and requirements and plan their schedules accordingly. Although the Box folder has all the syllabuses in one place, many times these syllabuses are added late to the folder. Additionally, the Box folder does contain syllabuses from past semesters, but not everyone has access to this folder. Those who are interested in transferring to the iSchool or who are interested in a minor can still see the resources from the project’s site, even though they lack access to the Box folder. Additionally, by being able to see comments and experiences from other students along with the grade disparity information, they can gain insights into the workload, difficulty level, and specific topics of a course before they enroll. This can help them avoid taking classes that may not be a good fit for their academic goals and interests. It may also help them spread out classes that might require more effort or time than others across multiple semesters. It would also help students foresee expenses like required textbooks and spread those expenses across multiple semesters. 

It will be an open-source project as the code will be freely available on GitHub for others to access and remix to their own needs. Open source software is “software that can be freely accessed, used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition” (Open Source Initiative, n.d.). This project will utilize an open source copyleft license, which is a “method for making a software program free, while requiring that all modified and extended versions of the program also be free, and released under the same terms and conditions” (Murray, 2020). One specific license that may potentially be utilized is the GNU General Public License v3.0 which is a strong copyleft license that is “conditioned on making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license. Copyright and license notices must be preserved” (GitHub, Inc., n.d.). This license allows for commercial use, distribution, modification, patent use, and private use and requires that sources must be disclosed and that a copy of the license and copyright notice must be included in the material. This allows others to use, view, and modify the source code created by this project and requires them to include where the source code came from. Ideally, other schools and colleges utilize this project’s source code. Since this project will solely be focusing on iSchool courses, other colleges within this university can utilize the code for their own purposes too. Another benefit of this project being open source is that it offers an opportunity for students to gain experience without having to apply to a competitive internship or research position that their lack of experience may prevent them from being hired at.

### The Community
  
#### Target Contributors and Users
This project’s target contributors would be iSchool students or those interested in taking iSchool classes, which includes those interested in transferring into the iSchool or those interested in minoring in an iSchool minor. Due to the iSchool’s undergraduate curriculum, knowing some programming is required and knowing more intermediate or advanced programming is encouraged. Additionally, there are iSchool courses about web development. These equip many iSchool students with skills that can be helpful to this project. Many iSchool students also participate in independent or extracurricular programming or development projects. This means that iSchool students are especially well equipped to participate in this project. However, even within the iSchool, programming and development experiences varies. We would create tasks according to this range of knowledge, allowing even those with no experience with programming to contribute. Those who participate in extracurricular projects sometimes aim to pad their resume or portfolio with these projects, others simply find them interesting and want to grow their skills, and many fall under both categories. Therefore, this project would be marketed as a way to improve skills and a way to make themselves more competitive job applicants. Since this is something that would make these students’ lives more convenient, that may serve as additional motivation for them to contribute to the project. The project team would also reach out to professors, especially those who teach programming or development skills, and request they grant extra credit to contributors. The team would explain the benefits of the project as well as the skills utilized or learned in hopes of convincing the professors. However, it is possible that all of them say no, so this would not be an advertised benefit unless professors agreed. The project team would also reach out to the iSchool staff and advisors and request that major contributors to this project be granted practicum experience or credit. In that instance, contributors would have to make large enough contributions that take almost the whole semester to develop. That may mean creating large enhancements (like potentially incorporating a course planner into the project) or major updates. Finally, professors may be considered contributors if they send in their updated syllabuses or offer expertise.

There is an overlap between the predicted contributors and the users of this project. Since many iSchool students have the technical ability and/or a vested interest, those who contribute are likely to use the resource as well. Additionally, even students who do not contribute may use the resource at least once a semester in preparation of registering for iSchool classes, given the project is comprehensive enough at the time of registration preparation. 

#### Welcoming Contributors

Once the project site has been created, the site’s home page would introduce the aims and contents of the project. Until then, contributors can be sourced through word of mouth and can be onboarded by the Project Manager, who will have to create at least a simple GitHub repository (which will be discussed further later). The project site would include the mission statement as well as the resources available for student use on the site. Also included on the home page would be a section that welcomed help. That section would include information on any and all contributions being welcome, no matter the level of experience or skill. It would link to a main page for contributors. This main page would list the benefits of contributing. The page would include a link to a guidance tree (a very simplified version of this can be seen below). The guidance tree would direct potential contributors to information on how they can contribute based on their interests and skills. Additionally, there would be a link to an FAQ and the Slack join link where communications occur. These three items would be highlighted, but there would also be a link to the GitHub repository where all the versions of the site’s code would be visible, along with a project board where issues can be held and categorized, the schedule, and the vocabulary control (a rudimentary example of this can be seen below the guidance tree example). The repository’s “readme” file would include contact information for those filling the current leadership roles within the project along with an onboarding message that directs contributors to relevant next steps. It would also include basic information about the project to help familiarize readers with the project’s aims and background. Additionally, the contributor page on the project site would include a leaderboard for contributors.

#### Incentivizing Contributors
As mentioned before, some iSchool students may be incentivized simply by gaining experience they can then use for their resumes, portfolios, or within job interviews and applications. Potential benefits mentioned earlier like expanding one’s experience, potential extra credit, and creating a beneficial resource for the community would all be highlighted on the contributor page on the project site. This benefits section would also encourage students to ask for benefits from their professors or the iSchool. Personalized and specific requests for extra credit are more likely to be responded to positively by professors. Although the site would not create a template, it would provide specific talking points for requesting extra credit (like “gaining real world experience” and “there is a shareable work history”).

The project would also utilize gamification to incentivize contributors. Gamification is “the process of using game mechanics, elements, and principles and applying them to non-game contexts to engage users better” (Valamis, 2022). There would be explicit goals and statuses, and it would utilize points and badges. There would be a monthly leaderboard and the top contributor of each month would win a specific badge for contributing the most. This leaderboard would tap into contributors’ competitiveness and motivate them to contribute more. Certain badges could be used to share what skills contributors have used, with specific skills or experiences explicitly associated with specific badges. For example, a non-technical badge could be “Communicator” if a contributor reached out to a certain number of professors for updated syllabuses. As more work is done withing that same topic, levels of a badge can be earned (like beginner, intermediate, expert, etc.). These badges would be shown with individual contributor information. An example of this is shown below. An example of a technical badge could be associated with fixing or debugging a specific issue. This would be measured through issue management on GitHub. The leaderboard would be translated over to the site through a Python package that still needs to be determined.

#### Communications
As mentioned before, the project will utilize GitHub as a way to host code and facilitate onboarding. Issues will be shared here along with timelines and resources. However, for more day-to-day communications, Slack will be used. Slack will allow new and experienced members of the project to share their questions, feedback, concerns, and more. It allows for quick replies and for anyone from that channel to reply, decreasing the burden of communication on leaders. Additionally, Slack “organizes conversations into dedicated spaces called channels” (Slack Technologies, n.d.). By utilizing channels for separating different topics, communication can be extremely clear and efficient while still encouraging feedback and new ideas. Amongst public channels, there will be an updates channel (the initial general channel Slack already creates) for larger, project-wide information that needs to be shared. There will be a “New Members” channel to help new members onboard smoothly and create a space for them to ask questions. There will be a “Programming” channel for coding-specific communications, such as asking questions or sharing resources. Slack public channels are easily searchable, making information, even older information, easy to find. Additionally, the project will utilize automation through bots to answer predicted questions or direct members to appropriate resources. These are called reply bots and “reply bots respond when someone uses a specific phrase, and are the easiest bots to make. These are perfect for automatically answering questions that tend to come up often on Slack” (Pot, 2022). Additionally, more channels can be added as the need arises. There are likely to be fewer private channels. One private channel would be amongst current leadership to voice concerns, ask role-specific questions or project-wide questions, and to share ideas. This channel would need to be private as some concerns may be about project members or security. Additionally, some of the leadership communication is not necessary for other members to know and may reduce clarity and order if everyone had access to it. Other private channels can be added as necessary. The creation of public and private channels will allow for the flow of communication to be controlled and be as informative and useful as possible.

### Project Lifecycle and Sustainability
Luckily, this project requires semi-annual updating as that is when new syllabuses are introduced and will need to be added to the site. Some professors may have the same syllabus semester after semester, but others add minor tweaks, so all classes offered must be reviewed and syllabuses must be updated as soon as available. Additionally, different classes are available each semester. The course catalog must also be updated. Due to these requirements, as long as the leadership and contributor roles are filled, the project is not likely to fall out of sync since consistent updates are required. More will be discussed about this in the *Platform and Language Logistics* section. As mentioned earlier, contributors will be sourced from within the iSchool student population. Depending on how well known the project is, the level of marketing required will fluctuate. Some semesters, many students may be aware of and choose to participate in the project. Other semesters, participation may decrease, which would require more aggressive marketing towards iSchool (or iSchool-adjacent) students. Initially, the project will require more contributors to create the site. I expect the site’s initial development to take six months, which means the site’s first semester providing information on IS classes will be Spring 2024. During the first month of this stage, recruiting contributors and onboarding them will be the priority. The project’s timeline and the project’s initial issues must also be created. The rest of the months will see the site being built and historical syllabi and comments being submitted. After those six months of development, the site will have to collect the next semester’s syllabi. We may have to release a test version or a beta version for that spring semester in order to find any concerns or issues. During the next three months after the site’s launch, there will likely be quite a bit of troubleshooting and cleaning up of the site. There may be a need to rescope parts of the project. However, by the time classes are released for the Fall 2024 semester, the site will hopefully be running smoothly. 

To maintain and update the site, fewer contributors will be necessary—perhaps even as little as three to four major technical contributors and three to four administrative and research contributors. These numbers do not include individuals who contribute by commenting and sharing their experiences. It is difficult to predict how many individuals would be necessary during the initial semesters of the site being live—ideally each course or section has at least one or two comments. Since individuals can comment on multiple courses and these comments are useful even after that semester is over, we will need commenters more during the beginning of the project than during later stages.

#### Semesterly Development/Maintenance Cycle

This project will use the Schedule Model. An example of the predicted flow of contributions over time is below. Contributions are expected to vary greatly depending on what part of the school year is currently occurring. Approximately midway through the previous semester, updates and development for the next semester should start. Once the university’s course catalog for the following semester is released, tasks should go out that aim to develop the site’s iSchool course catalog for the next semester. This means the project’s calendar-based cycle depends on the university’s timeline. As placeholders, existing syllabuses should be attached to each respective class and there should be a clear label indicating that the syllabus is out-of-date.  Comments from previous semesters should be attached to the same class so that users who are preparing to register for classes can see all relevant comments without having to waste time going through past semesters. After this “pre-semester” version is complete, the project team can send out a newsletter if there are any major updates or just a notification that the site is ready. This can be done through either collecting emails of users through the site or (ideally) reaching out to the iSchool and incorporating the update into the college-wide newsletter (students get a weekly email from the iSchool that shares information on upcoming events, opportunities, and other useful information). By the first week of the relevant semester, syllabuses should be updated. This can be done by students of that course submitting syllabuses (these can be fact-checked by comparing with older syllabuses or the iSchool Box folder), checking if the iSchool Box folder is updated, or by individuals reaching out to professors. Ideally, if and when the site is more established, professors will have created a habit of sending in their syllabuses and less work from student contributors will be required.

Although there are summer and winter term classes, until the project has been developed further, we will not be incorporating those into the project’s scope. That will require more consistent contribution and until the project has built up a community of enough participants, there may not be enough resources to incorporate those smaller terms into the project. Once there are more contributors and support, the project team will rescope and ideally incorporate those terms into the project. 

#### Platform and Language Logistics

The site platform this project would utilize would be the university’s cPanel Web Hosting Service (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, n.d.). This is a free resource for students attached to their @illinois.edu email. As students graduate, ownership can be transferred. Additionally, co-owners are easily added and @illinois.edu emails are not required for co-ownership. This platform allows the use of a variety of languages. The project would likely utilize HTML, CSS, and Python. This allows for contributors of varying experience to still contribute. Additionally, these are widely known and relevant languages that are often sought after by companies, meaning contributors have an extra incentive to participate and practice their skills. There are also many resources available for these languages if contributors wish to learn or if the site needs upgrading or troubleshooting. As the languages’ updates are released, the project team will in turn have to update the code. This will require the update manager to remain aware of language updates and in turn, create or change tasks and instructions. 
#### Permissions and Access
Although the code will be readily available for people to view and remix from on GitHub, only a select few individuals will have editing power over the project’s site itself. As mentioned before, one individual using their @illinois.edu email will “own” the site and others can co-own the site. The Project Manager will own the site and transfer ownership as needed if they choose to step down or when they graduate. They will grant co-ownership to individuals who hold roles within the project. Although these roles are not static and are likely to expand or contract as the project develops, there will at least be an Update Manager, a Lead Programmer, and a Fact Checker. The Update Manager will ensure semesterly updates as a whole are moving smoothly as well as ensuring the language and technology is not out of date. The Lead Programmer will review the code and in case of complications, take the lead in fixing or delegating the issues. The Fact Checker will ensure the accuracy of the site. This includes checking syllabuses or asking others to check syllabuses to make sure submitters have not edited the document by cross-checking with other submissions or older syllabuses. They will also ensure all resources related to a course or section are appropriate and accurate (for example, making sure links to textbooks are still working). The Project Manager works to ensure these three (for now) roles are filled and duties are being fulfilled. They also are in charge of communications and networking (for example, reaching out to the iSchool or sending out notifications). If this project becomes larger in the future, it may be necessary for a Communications Role to be created. These roles will be filled through seeing who major contributors are and reaching out to see if they would want to fill the leadership role pertinent to their skills, reaching out to specific individuals, or hosting applications to fill these roles. The method of filling the roles will likely change depending on the pool of contributors and interested parties. In the beginning of the project, there may be a need to reach out to specific individuals due to a lack of publicity and public knowledge of the project.

### Conclusion      
Ideally, this project results in a less stressful class registration period for students taking iSchool classes. It will decrease financial burdens as well as academic burdens while providing students with an opportunity to grow their skills, become more marketable professionals, give back to their community, and potentially gain some extra credit. Additionally, those who take leadership roles can grow their non-technical skills like leadership and communication. Due to the variety of skill levels welcomed and needed along with the ebb and flow of necessary contributions over the school year, hopefully the project allows anyone who wants to contribute to be able to contribute. After the project gains traction, ideally there is a need to rescope and add new features to the project. One example of this could include adding a course planner that allows students to create mock schedules for their future semester. Another is incorporating a degree audit into the project, which could help students know what classes they still need to take in order to remain on track to graduate. The project could also expand beyond the iSchool and incorporate all classes from all colleges within the University of Illinois. No matter the size of the project though, it should remain a free and constantly updated resource for students of the iSchool.
