### Abstract 

#### Aims
This paper proposes a blockchain gamification project designed for a large national insurance company to openly provide financial and digital literacy courses to existing and prospective customers, while incentivizing them to earn crypto tokens that can be applied towards their premium with the company. The project aims to both bring insurance companies into the blockchain space, and to help insurance companies truly impact and educate the communities that they service, contributing to individuals' and families' stability and generational wealth.

#### Specifications
The proposed platform will be built on blockchain technology, and specifically Ethereum. Blockchain has many benefits, namely: immutability, transparency, non-censorship, and traceability (Budhi, 2022). Gamification elements are introduced in order to incentivize customers to complete courses and improve their financial and digital literacy. Customers earn tokens for completing courses, which can be applied towards their premium with the company. This tokenomics system creates a mutually beneficial environment for both the customers and the insurance company, as customers benefit from improved financial and digital literacy, and increased trust in the company, while the insurance company gains more informed and responsible customers, and potentially new customers.

The platform is designed to be welcoming to all, as those seeking digital and financial literacy information are assumably starting from a more baseline understanding of these concepts, so it is highly important to create a user-friendly UI/UX, as well as uncomplicated educational courses. Financial literacy course topics will begin with more elementary subjects focused on: budgeting, credit, investing, taxes, digital payments, and insurance. Financial literacy courses will then progress into more advanced topics such as: portfolio management, retirement planning, starting a small business, estate planning, and risk management. Digital literacy courses will also begin with basics like: internet navigation, online privacy & security, digital communication, online collaboration, digital citizenship. Advanced digital literacy courses will include: cybersecurity, programming, artificial intelligence & machine learning, blockchain & cryptocurrency, internet of things (IoT). Within each topic module, users will complete activities such as watching videos, minigames, community discussion boards, quizzes, and more in order to earn tokens and unlock advanced topics. Gamification elements will also incentivize further community interaction and platform contribution through participation in activities like surveys, providing educational articles and links to the community, and other interactive activities. The platform is designed with some level of adaptability, and future-thinking in mind to allow for the community to shape its development as much as the insurance company, just like a true decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). With this in mind, courses are allowed to be adapted to support the needs of the community, and there will be feedback/discussion avenues created to allow for the community to adjust the educational content and strategies of the platform based on an established voting system, as detailed later in the paper.

#### Mutual Benefit
This project will have a positive impact on both customers and the insurance company. When considering the customers, the platform provides those interested in bettering themselves, engaging further with an insurance company, or just generally capitalizing on a free opportunity an engaging, educational, and community-based method of learning about financial and digital literacy, making the customer far better-equipped to make informed, intelligent decisions in many facets of quotidian life. When considering the insurance company, the platform provides a way to differentiate themselves from their competitors, by showing they truly care for customers, and in innovative service differentiation.

### Introduction

#### Why Blockchain?

Technology has become increasingly important on the global stage, and especially within the insurance industry. In their 2016 Global FinTech Survey, PwC reports:

> “Insurance companies are very much aware of the FinTech revolution: 74% of respondents see FinTech innovations as a challenge for their industry…43% of the industry
  players claim they have FinTech at the heart of their corporate strategies, but only 28% explore partnerships with FinTech companies and even less than 14% actively
  participate in ventures and/or incubator programs” (PwC, 2016).
  
Clearly, despite an acknowledged need to adapt to upcoming technology in the insurance space, even industry incumbents seem unlikely, or are facing challenges adapting to new FinTech in the space. Already, Insurtech startups are using technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain to create innovative solutions that challenge traditional insurance models (PwC, 2019). This is where blockchain comes in. Blockchain can be leveraged by the right player to revolutionize the insurance industry by increasing transparency, reducing fraud, and improving customer engagement.

In essence, blockchain is a decentralized, public ledger, or database that records all transactions across many network nodes (Hayes, 2023). It has become essentially eponymous, in modern society, with technologies like Bitcoin. However, blockchain has further-reaching potential, especially as it relates to the insurance industry through other associated elements such as smart contracts. Smart contracts are essentially just code that will automatically execute when certain conditions are confirmed to have been met (Frankenfield, 2023). Within the scope of this project, smart contracts can be employed to automate the rewards process for end users, though further applications for smart contracts within the insurance industry are discussed later in the paper.

Blockchain is especially attractive to insurance companies for its power to incite community engagement and trust. Younger generations such as Gen Z and Millennials, highly prefer for insurance providers to directly educate them on insurance products and services that align with their personal life goals, thus creating a need that the insurance industry can directly fulfill through an educational blockchain gamification platform (Chubb, 2022). While older generations are more likely to be financially literate, and more self-assured in their insurance decisions, they are often left behind in the digital revolution, with a 35 percentage point disparity existing in smartphone adoption between 18-29 year olds and adults aged 65 years or older, according to a Pew Research Center study (Faverio, 2022). Thus, insurance providers can fulfill a clear demand for both financial and digital literacy education in both younger and older generations alike, which they look to serve all the same.

#### Insurance Scope

It is critical for insurance companies to educate their customers on financial and digital literacy because it can contribute to further social good in advancing citizens’ overall financial wellbeing and reducing socioeconomic risk. Through increased knowledge of financial topics such as budgeting, saving, and investing, customers are better equipped to make strong financial decisions, and more likely to invest in insurance. Digital literacy is also important because as technology continues to penetrate the insurance industry,customers who are not digitally literate are put at a definite disadvantage. Additionally, financial and digital literacy are important for people of all ages to learn. For younger generations, financial literacy can help them establish good financial habits early on, which can lead to long-term financial stability. For older generations, digital literacy is important, as technology permeates daily life, in work, education, and insurance. 

Already, many insurance industry leaders are dedicated to serving the communities that they service. Companies notable for their corporate social responsibility, and dedication to social good include: Lemonade, Nationwide, and CSAA Insurance Group (Tobin, 2022). Furthermore, some companies, like American Family Insurance, even have an arm of the organization dedicated to social impact. Take for example, the American Family Institute, dedicated to: “Closing equity gaps across America” (American Family Insurance Institute for Corporate and Social Impact, n.d.). Clearly, a project of this matter is greatly in line with national insurance companies’ interests.

### Purpose

Currently, American citizens stand to greatly improve their station in life through digital and financial literacy education. However, there are many barriers to reaching and effectively impacting target audiences such widespread accessibility and meaningful content. Therefore, national insurance providers comitted to social impact can create educational blockchain gamification platforms, such as the one outlined in this paper, to educate consumers at no cost, while creating a mutually beneficial, trust-based partnership with consumers.

### Target Market

#### Motivations

The target market for this project is highly diverse in terms of demographics. Creed, race, gender, and income levels are socioeconomic factors that should not ever disqualify one from receiving insurance coverage, and so it follows that such a platform is also open to serving a diverse group of individuals not limited by any of these factors. Still, some bias may be introduced to the community on the platform in that those who choose to engage with this project will likely be individuals of a similar mindset: interested in, and motivated to improve their financial and digital skills. 

This target market includes both existing and prospective customers of the national insurance company that takes on this project. Additionally, individuals who may have no connections to the company but are interested in learning more about personal finance and technology may also use the platform, though perhaps through interacting with the community and finding value in the platform, they may be enticed to become a customer of the insurance provider.

#### Age

One key demographic for this platform is younger generations, specifically Millennials and Gen Z. These generations, in particular, are shown to struggle at unprecedented levels with student loans debt as compared to older generations (see Figure 1). What is even more worrying is an overestimation of their own financial literacy capabilities. As captured by Ted Beck, the President and CEO of the National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE): “Millennials are known for having unrelenting belief in their own abilities. This generation is diverse and highly educated. However, their overconfidence puts them in an extremely fragile financial position, and sadly, they don’t realize it” (NEFE, 2017). A blockchain gamification platform that provides education on financial topics such as budgeting, saving, and investing stands to help younger generations improve their financial stability and make more resilient financial decisions.

Another important demographic for this platform is older adults, particularly seniors above the age of 65 years old. This generation is less apt to be familiar with technology (see Figure 2), and is approaching retirement. Worryingly, approximately one-third of Americans have zero retirement savings (GoBankingRates, 2016). In combination with an aforementioned need for seniors’ digital inclusion, it is clear to see how an educational blockchain gamification platform can benefit this demographic.

#### Economic Equity

This platform is also beneficial to individuals who may not have had access to traditional financial education, such as low-income individuals or those from underserved communities. Analysis of data from a study conducted by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) found that: “ In general, financial literacy is lowest among the young, women, and people with less education…” (Mollenkamp, 2022). A blockchain gamification platform that provides education on these topics, as well as digital literacy topics such as online banking and budgeting apps, could help increase financial literacy and reduce the risk of financial exploitation in underserved communities.

### Blockchain

**Ethereum** is one of the leading blockchain platforms globally, and the selected platform for this project. 

#### Open Source Smart contracts

Ethereum was the first blockchain platform to support smart contracts written by programmers (Chainlink, 2023). Smart contracts, as mentioned earlier, can automate processes,thus making them an essential tool for gamifying the platform, and essentially carrying out all necessary working functions of the platform. Smart contracts can automate various gamification aspects such as: tracking user progress, awarding tokens for completing learning tasks, and displaying milestone accomplishments. 

Smart contract development can be a highly collaborative process given that, by nature, smart contracts tend to be open source documents. To elaborate, there exists **open source smart contract libraries**, thereby allowing developers to create the necessary smart contracts for this project from an established starting point, rather than entirely from scratch (Ethereum, 2022). Presumably, in sourcing applicable smart contracts, and interacting with those on such a large blockchain platform, like Ethereum, developers are likely to encounter others who may also be interested in the project and would like to become interested as developers, or even end users.

#### Trust & Scalability

Ethereum offers a high degree of security given its incumbency and time to mature within the blockchain space, which is especially a priority for a project of this nature, as insurance companies are depended upon to be highly trustworthy and secure. More information on Ethereum's cryptographic practices can be found [here](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/how-ethereum-works-part-1-cryptography-consensus-and-transactions/), and a supporting diagram can be seen below in Figure 3.

Ethereum is also very friendly in terms of scalability. Sharding and layer 2 solutions like Plasma and Rollups, ensure that the platform can handle a large number of users and transactions, this is very similar to side/parachains (Techskill Brew, 2022). This aspect is a priority given the scope of a large national insurance company, which would likely herald in a high volume of users and following interactions.

#### Tokenomics

In order to incentivize activity on the platform, players will be rewarded primarily through native tokens, that the insurance company creates specifically for the DAO. Doing so will require some investment from the company. However, there is little to no risk from this investment given:
- The insurance company is funding this project through its "non-profit" arm which is business profits set aside, already, for charitable causes
- The investment will be "returned" to the company when it is put towards a premium on products with the business
- It will incentivize new customers for the company, ultimately increasin gprofits, and returning the initial investment "tenfold"

When concerned with specific tokenomics rates, it will be up to the DAO to decide such specifics like burn rates, trade-in values, and more. Most DAOS assign "power" based on ownership within the DAO, thus those earning more tokens to contribute to the DAO will have the most say in these decisions--thereby further incentivizing activity, and community collaboration.

### Gamification

**Gamification is an important working open principle for this project.** Gamification mechanics will be employed within this platform in order to foster a dedicated, supportive community of learners, who can further contribute to the sustainability of the platform.

#### Rewards & Incentives

Most obviously, rewards and incentives will be used to motivate users to engage with the platform. Users can earn tokens for completing educational modules by completing the activities within such as quizzes, watching videos, and minigame (all of which have their own gamification elements).

#### Progress Tracking

Tracking progress throughout modules via a simple progress bar is an effective way for users to keep motivated and continue to set goals. Additionally, progress can be tracked through more static elements such as badges or other visual representations, like NFTs as they complete educational modules.

#### Community Elements

Mechanics such as leaderboards incite some friendly competitions and allow users to engage with others in the community by allowing them to congratulate each other and externally motivate each other. Additionally, discussion boards would allow for users to exchange knowledge they are learning in order to further the educational impact of the platform, as well as converse directly with insurance agents to see input on financial decisions they are making, and thus foster important customer relatiosnhips.

### Sustainability & Next Steps

The future success of this platform is entirely dependent upon continued community engagement on the platform. While members may initially join on the end user side because they would like to take advantage of the incentives, they will only continue to engage with the platform if they feel they gain value from the education content provided, and if they feel truly connected to the community of people on the platform. In this light, it is important for developers to work closely with advisors and the community when designing the educational content on the platform, being open to updates, changes, and additions to the content as valid desire arises. Additionally, it is important that the insurance company becomes an active leader, themselves on the platform as they should recognize that they have much power to create a close-knit community environment on the platform through many of the aforementioned social engagememnt techniques, but even beyond what is explicitly mentioned, e.g. offering 1:1 financial advising, agents sharing their insurance journeys and how it has benefitted them via community posts etc.

To accomplish this project, a major player in the national insurance industry would have to take interest in a project of this sort. Next, they would have to find a team of dedicated and skilled developers in the blockchain space, specifically ones with knowledge of smart contract creation. Given the novelty of this technology, skilled developers in this space are able to charge large amounts for their services, so insurance companies should keep that in mind. The project will take, most definitely, upwards of four months before it can be launched to the public, though it will likely be advantageous to market this launch more so as a testing of the platform so as to **involve the community in improving its development**--marketing in this fashion makes users more likely to provide feedback on the initial development.

Once developed, all within the community must undertsand the adaptability required of the environment, as a true DAO allows for all to have ownership in the community. In essence, all members of the community will have say in decisions on the platform, the extent of eahc members' power, however, is dependent upon what the DAO decides, somewhat of a democratic feedback loop (see FIgure 5).

### Conclusion

In all, a blockchain gamification platform focused on digital and financial literacy for a large national insurance company has the potential to be an innovative and effective tool for promoting financial and digital literacy education amongst the general American public. Blockchain technology can be leveraged for its transparency, security, and decentralization, and gamification can create a platform offering users a unique and engaging learning experience that promotes digital and financial literacy. Ultimately, this project serves both corporate resonsibility interests and the betterment of citizens.
